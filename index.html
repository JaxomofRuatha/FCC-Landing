    <h1>Your information. Adapted to how you use it. Anywhere. Anytime.</h1>
    <p>
      Have you found yourself switching between countless applications, taking
      advantage of only one feature of each to organize your thoughts and information
      the way you want it? Do you find far too much time spent on making your
      work and notes translate between programs? Wouldn't it be fantastic if
      you could keep everything in one place and have it available to you in the
      format you need, on the cloud, synchronized in real time?
      <br><br>
      Good news: it's finally possible with NoteVerse.
